# Targets Overview

This repo provides an overview with some examples, of the [`targets`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) R package. 

An overview presentation can be found [here](https://jennysjaarda.github.io/targets_overview/overview_presentation/presentation.html#1).

In theory (untested), you should be able to clone this repository and rerun the code and or presentation after you have installed and loaded the necessary libraries, you *should* be able to do this easily by calling `renv::restore()` to install all the packages. The presentation with various bits of code can be found in the `docs/` folder, specifically the `Rmd` file is [here](https://github.com/jennysjaarda/targets_overview/blob/master/docs/overview_presentation/presentation.Rmd). This file may be most useful for testing and trying out the package as it also contains hidden pieces of code that aren't in the rendered presentation.

If you have any questions feel free to ask! I'll do my best to help :)
