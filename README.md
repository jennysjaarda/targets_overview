# Targets Overview

This repo provides an overview with some examples, of the [`targets`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) R package. 

Some overview slides can be found [here](https://jennysjaarda.github.io/targets_overview/overview_presentation/presentation.html#36).

In theory (untested), you should be able to clone this repository and rerun the code and or presentation after you have installed and loaded the necessary libraries, you *should* be able to do this easily by calling `renv::restore()` to install all the packages. 

If you have any questions feel free to ask! I'll do my best to help :)
